View() with capital 'V' is used to view the structure of a data frame

str() is used to get the structure of a data frame. Here's the output:

 $ names: chr  "izu" "chi"
 $ ages : num  5 6
 
 we can then return the values of a data frame by putting a dollar sign in from of the
 of the variable
 
 Example myname$ages
 
 
 To get row and columns, we use index [row, column].
 
 Example: myname[1,1] returns row 1, column 1
 myname[1, ] returns row 1 and all columns (when you leave it blank)
 myname [ , 1] returns all row and first column
 myname[1,2] returns row 1 and second column
 
 library(tidyverse)
 tidyverse includes a lot of datasets
 table(msleep$vore)
 ##Accessing a list of built in data in R
 data()
 
 Here is example of R inbuilt data with description:
 women      Average Heights and Weights for American Women
 
 to view the data, use: View(women), it will open up the data in another tab as a table
 
 
 pipe operator: shift + Ctrl + M
 
 
 
The formula for calculating the Body Mass Index (BMI) should use height in meters for the calculation. If your height is in inches, you'll need to convert it to meters (1 inch = 0.0254 meters) before calculating BMI.

Here's a corrected version of your code, assuming height is in inches and weight is in pounds:

r
Copy code
library(dplyr)

women %>%
  filter(height > 60 & weight < 130) %>%
  mutate(body_mass_index = (weight / (height * 0.0254)^2))
If your height is already in meters, you can use the original calculation without conversion:

r
Copy code
library(dplyr)

women %>%
  filter(height > 1.524 & weight < 130) %>%  # Adjusting height to meters if necessary
  mutate(body_mass_index = weight / (height^2))
Make sure to adjust the filtering conditions based on the units of your height.

you can also convert height before putting it into the formular, this way:
women %>%
  filter(height > 60 & weight < 130) %>% 
  mutate(height_in_meters = height / 100, 
         bmi = weight / (height_in_meters^2)) %>% 
  select(weight, height_in_meters, bmi)
 
 arrange(-/+) equivalent to 'ORDER BY'

str() –for structure – in terms of row and columns

glimpse() quick overview of variables and data types

head() first six rows (as well as all the columns) extra info like # A tibble: 6 × 14 (6 rows and 14 variables)

class(starwars$skin_color) – shows the data type of a particular variable (i.e. a column). Skin_color is a variable in starwars dataset
[1] "character"

length() gives the number of variables (aka columns) in a dataset

names() gives all the names of the variables

table()

 
 
 
# ℹ 48 more rows
# ℹ Use `print(n = ...)` to see more rows

 
 
 starwars %>% 
  select (1:3) #starting from the first column,select up to the third column. This returns only 10 rows.
  
  starwars %>% 
  select (2:3) #starting from the second column,select up to the third column. This returns only 10 rows.
  
  to return more than 10 rows, use print(n = ...)
  
  select returns variables in a dataset
  
# filter rows
starwars %>% 
  select (mass, sex) %>% 
  filter(mass < 55 &
           sex == "male")
  
  filter is used to filter the dataset based on the value of a particular row. Example:
  starwars %>% 
  filter(startsWith(sex, "m")) #this will return all columns where the column [sex] starts with "m"
  
  If you want a particular column, first use select to return the columns before apply a filter function
  
  Renaming a column (aka variable)
  women %>% 
  rename ("new name" = "old name") %>% 
  head()
 

 Recording data with recode() function using tidyverse
 starwars %>% 
  select (sex) %>% --this line is necessary to show only the [sex] column. Otherwise, all columns would be returned
  mutate(sex = recode(sex, "male" = "man",
                      "female" = "woman"))
                      
  na means not available
  rm remove
  na.rm means don't include missing records
   mean(starwars$height, na.rm = TRUE)
[1] 174.6049
  
  The na.omit() function in R is used to remove rows from a data frame or vector that contain NA (missing) values. It’s particularly useful when you want to ensure that analyses or calculations do not include any incomplete observations. Here’s how and when to use it:
  
   df_1 <- data.frame(
+     Name = c("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", NA),
+     Height = c(5.5, NA, 6.0, 5.8),
+     Age = c(25, 30, NA, 22)
+ )
> df_1
     Name Height Age
1   Alice    5.5  25
2     Bob     NA  30
3 Charlie    6.0  NA
4    <NA>    5.8  22
> clean_df_1 <- na.omit(df_1)
> clean_df_1
   Name Height Age
1 Alice    5.5  25

distinct() is used to remove duplicates:
students %>% 
  distinct()
  
  or 
distinct(students)

long_data equivalent to unpivot
wide_data equivalent to pivot

R does not have a built-in mode function, but you can define one yourself

In R, the drop_na() function is used to remove rows with NA (missing) values from a data frame or tibble. It is part of the tidyr package, which is commonly used for data cleaning and manipulation.

Using drop_na():
To remove rows with any NA values:
cleaned_df <- drop_na(df)



Removing NA from Specific Columns:
If you want to drop rows with NA values only in specific columns, you can specify those columns:
cleaned_df_specific <- drop_na(df, Height)
