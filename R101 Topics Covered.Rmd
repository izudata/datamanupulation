View() with capital 'V' is used to view the structure of a data frame

str() is used to get the structure of a data frame. Here's the output:

 $ names: chr  "izu" "chi"
 $ ages : num  5 6
 
 we can then return the values of a data frame by putting a dollar sign in from of the
 of the variable
 
 Example myname$ages
 
 
 To get row and columns, we use index [row, column].
 
 Example: myname[1,1] returns row 1, column 1
 myname[1, ] returns row 1 and all columns (when you leave it blank)
 myname [ , 1] returns all row and first column
 myname[1,2] returns row 1 and second column
 
 
 ##Accessing a list of built in data in R
 data()
 
 Here is example of R inbuilt data with description:
 women      Average Heights and Weights for American Women
 
 to view the data, use: View(women), it will open up the data in another tab as a table
 
 
 pipe operator: shift + Ctrl + M
 
 
 
The formula for calculating the Body Mass Index (BMI) should use height in meters for the calculation. If your height is in inches, you'll need to convert it to meters (1 inch = 0.0254 meters) before calculating BMI.

Here's a corrected version of your code, assuming height is in inches and weight is in pounds:

r
Copy code
library(dplyr)

women %>%
  filter(height > 60 & weight < 130) %>%
  mutate(body_mass_index = (weight / (height * 0.0254)^2))
If your height is already in meters, you can use the original calculation without conversion:

r
Copy code
library(dplyr)

women %>%
  filter(height > 1.524 & weight < 130) %>%  # Adjusting height to meters if necessary
  mutate(body_mass_index = weight / (height^2))
Make sure to adjust the filtering conditions based on the units of your height.

you can also convert height before putting it into the formular, this way:
women %>%
  filter(height > 60 & weight < 130) %>% 
  mutate(height_in_meters = height / 100, 
         bmi = weight / (height_in_meters^2)) %>% 
  select(weight, height_in_meters, bmi)
 
 arrange(-/+) equivalent to 'ORDER BY'
 
plot()

str() –for structure – in terms of row and columns

glimpse() quick over view data type

head() first six rows (as well as all the columns) extra info like # A tibble: 6 × 14 (6 rows and 14 variables)

class(starwars$skin_color) – shows the data type of a particular variable (i.e. a column). Skin_color is a variable in starwars dataset
[1] "character"

length() gives the number of variables (aka columns) in a dataset

names() gives all the names of the variables

 
 
 
# ℹ 48 more rows
# ℹ Use `print(n = ...)` to see more rows

 
 
 starwars %>% 
  select (1:3) #starting from the first column,select up to the third column. This returns only 10 rows.
  
  starwars %>% 
  select (2:3) #starting from the second column,select up to the third column. This returns only 10 rows.
  
  to return more than 10 rows, use print(n = ...)
  
  select returns variables in a dataset
  
  filter is used to filter the dataset based on the value of a particular row. Example:
  starwars %>% 
  filter(startsWith(sex, "m")) #this will return all columns where the column [sex] starts with "m"
  
  If you want a particular column, first use select to return the columns before apply a filter function
