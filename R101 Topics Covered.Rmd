View() with capital 'V' is used to view the structure of a data frame

str() is used to get the structure of a data frame. Here's the output:

 $ names: chr  "izu" "chi"
 $ ages : num  5 6
 
 we can then return the values of a data frame by putting a dollar sign in from of the
 of the variable
 
 Example myname$ages
 
 
 To get row and columns, we use index [row, column].
 
 Example: myname[1,1] returns row 1, column 1
 myname[1, ] returns row 1 and all columns (when you leave it blank)
 myname [ , 1] returns all row and first column
 myname[1,2] returns row 1 and second column

 tidyverse includes a lot of datasets

# You can omit using the word mapping. The first argument is x and second is y. After we have to be more specific

 Here is example of R inbuilt data with description:
 women      Average Heights and Weights for American Women
 
 to view the data, use: View(women), it will open up the data in another tab as a table
 
 
 pipe operator: shift + Ctrl + M
 
 
 
The formula for calculating the Body Mass Index (BMI) should use height in meters for the calculation. If your height is in inches, you'll need to convert it to meters (1 inch = 0.0254 meters) before calculating BMI.

Here's a corrected version of your code, assuming height is in inches and weight is in pounds:

r
Copy code
library(dplyr)

women %>%
  filter(height > 60 & weight < 130) %>%
  mutate(body_mass_index = (weight / (height * 0.0254)^2))
If your height is already in meters, you can use the original calculation without conversion:

r
Copy code
library(dplyr)

women %>%
  filter(height > 1.524 & weight < 130) %>%  # Adjusting height to meters if necessary
  mutate(body_mass_index = weight / (height^2))
Make sure to adjust the filtering conditions based on the units of your height.

you can also convert height before putting it into the formular, this way:
women %>%
  filter(height > 60 & weight < 130) %>% 
  mutate(height_in_meters = height / 100, 
         bmi = weight / (height_in_meters^2)) %>% 
  select(weight, height_in_meters, bmi)
 
 arrange(-/+) equivalent to 'ORDER BY'

str() –for structure – in terms of row and columns

glimpse() quick overview of variables and data types

head() first six rows (as well as all the columns) extra info like # A tibble: 6 × 14 (6 rows and 14 variables)

class(starwars$skin_color) – shows the data type of a particular variable (i.e. a column). Skin_color is a variable in starwars dataset
[1] "character"

length() gives the number of variables (aka columns) in a dataset

names() gives all the names of the variables

table()

 
 
 
# ℹ 48 more rows
# ℹ Use `print(n = ...)` to see more rows

 
 
 starwars %>% 
  select (1:3) #starting from the first column,select up to the third column. This returns only 10 rows.
  
  starwars %>% 
  select (2:3) #starting from the second column,select up to the third column. This returns only 10 rows.
  
  to return more than 10 rows, use print(n = ...)
  
  select returns variables in a dataset
  
# filter rows
starwars %>% 
  select (mass, sex) %>% 
  filter(mass < 55 &
           sex == "male")
  
  filter is used to filter the dataset based on the value of a particular row. Example:
  starwars %>% 
  filter(startsWith(sex, "m")) #this will return all columns where the column [sex] starts with "m"
  
  If you want a particular column, first use select to return the columns before apply a filter function
  
  Renaming a column (aka variable)
  women %>% 
  rename ("new name" = "old name") %>% 
  head()
 

 Recording data with recode() function using tidyverse
 starwars %>% 
  select (sex) %>% --this line is necessary to show only the [sex] column. Otherwise, all columns would be returned
  mutate(sex = recode(sex, "male" = "man",
                      "female" = "woman"))
                      
  na means not available
  rm remove
  na.rm means don't include missing records
   mean(starwars$height, na.rm = TRUE)

  The na.omit() function in R is used to remove rows from a data frame or vector that contain NA (missing) values. It’s particularly useful when you want to ensure that analyses or calculations do not include any incomplete observations. Here’s how and when to use it:
  
   df_1 <- data.frame(
+     Name = c("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", NA),
+     Height = c(5.5, NA, 6.0, 5.8),
+     Age = c(25, 30, NA, 22)
+ )
> df_1
     Name Height Age
1   Alice    5.5  25
2     Bob     NA  30
3 Charlie    6.0  NA
4    <NA>    5.8  22
> clean_df_1 <- na.omit(df_1)
> clean_df_1
   Name Height Age
1 Alice    5.5  25

distinct() is used to remove duplicates:
students %>% 
  distinct()
  
  or 
distinct(students)

long_data equivalent to unpivot
wide_data equivalent to pivot

R does not have a built-in mode function, but you can define one yourself

In R, the drop_na() function is used to remove rows with NA (missing) values from a data frame or tibble. It is part of the tidyr package, which is commonly used for data cleaning and manipulation.

Using drop_na():
To remove rows with any NA values:
cleaned_df <- drop_na(df)



Removing NA from Specific Columns:
If you want to drop rows with NA values only in specific columns, you can specify those columns:
cleaned_df_specific <- drop_na(df, Height)

# Geometry - shapes
ggplot is installed with tidyverse


geom_density(alpha = 0.2) alpha is how transparent a color is

 ggplot(mapping = aes(x = height, colour = sex, color is the color of the line while fill is the fill color
                                    fill = sex)
Key Components Explained:
drop_na(height): This removes any rows with missing values in the height column.

filter(sex %in% c("male", "female")): This keeps only the rows where sex is either "male" or "female".

ggplot(mapping = aes(x = height, fill = sex)): Sets up the plot, mapping height to the x-axis and using sex to fill colors.

geom_density(alpha = 0.5, position = "identity"): Adds density curves with a specified transparency.

scale_fill_manual(): Customizes the fill colors for each sex category.

theme_minimal(): Applies a minimal theme for a cleaner look.

labs(): Adds titles and labels to the axes.

 geom_point -- scatter plot
 
 # if geom smooth and facet_wrap are commented out, it will be a normal scatter plot

 facet_wrap(~sex) divides into different squares

         paired = FALSE)
 
 data =. #this tells R to put the data at this location (after lifeExp ~ continent)
 
 p-value < 2.2e-16 is too small. Therefore, we reject the Null Hypothesis. The probability of getting a sample like this, 
 if there were to be no difference in the mean life expectancy between Africa and Europe is extremely small.
 
 What does extremely small mean? We need to define the threshold where we can either accept or reject the null hypothesis. 
 Usually, we set the threshold at 5% or 0.05

 alternative hypothesis: true difference in means between group Africa and group Europe is not equal to 0
 
 Hypothesis Testing Context: In hypothesis testing, we typically start with two hypotheses:

The null hypothesis (H0), which usually states that there is no effect or no difference (in this case, that the true difference in means between the two groups is equal to 0).
The alternative hypothesis (H1 or Ha), which suggests that there is an effect or a difference.
Groups Being Compared: In your example, the two groups are "Africa" and "Europe." These could represent different populations, regions, or conditions.

True Difference in Means: This refers to the actual average values (means) of some measurement (like height, income, etc.) in the two groups.

Not Equal to 0: The phrase "not equal to 0" indicates that the alternative hypothesis posits that the average values of the two groups are different from each other. This can mean that the mean for Africa is greater than the mean for Europe, or vice versa.

Two-Tailed Test: This alternative hypothesis is typically used in a two-tailed test, which means that you are looking for any significant difference in either direction (greater or lesser).

ANOVA - Analysis of Variance for more the two means
the function is aov()

Box plot
stat_summary() for Mean:

fun = mean: Specifies that we want to calculate the mean.
geom = "point": Indicates that we want to add points.
shape = 18: Defines the shape of the mean points (a diamond shape).
color = "red": Colors the mean points red.
stat_summary() for Median:

Similar to the mean, but with fun = median, shape = 17 (triangle), and color = "blue" for the median points.
Position Adjustment: position_dodge(0.75) is used to slightly adjust the position of the points if needed, especially if there are multiple groups.

Legend: theme(legend.position = "none") is included to hide the legend, as it might not be necessary for just mean and median points
